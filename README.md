This repository provides a PDF file showing the contents of the master thesis in which the CenyML library was published in 2022 by César Miranda Meza. This work was titled as: "Machine learning library to support applications with embedded systems and parallel computing" and hopes not only to serve as proof of the publication of CenyML, but also to introduce anyone interested in Machine Learning from beginners to advanced. The author of this thesis wrote his paper believing that there are few or no written sources of information that address the explanation of Machine Learning from a mathematical approach and worse, that are easy to understand. However, in this thesis a great effort was made to properly introduce Machine Learning both from a mathematical perspective and from its implementation in software.
